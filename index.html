      <h3>Hello!</h3>
      <p>I am a 25 year old Portland based Student at Epicodus, with a <strong>passion</strong> for coding and development. As you navigate this webpage, I hope you learn a little about me and the work that I am capable of.</p>

      <h4>A little about me.</h4>
      <p>For most of my adult life, I could have been considered a wanderer. I travelled around the world, in and out of school, trying to figure out what I was passionate about. When I met my now wife, I settled down and started working for Starbucks. It was through their college assistance program that I started taking some web development classes, and I fell in love with it. Things with that school didn't work out, and that's where I found Epicodus!</p>

      <h4>Outside of work.</h4>
      <p>In my free time I like to go rock climbing. It is a perfect blend of physical fitness, problem solving, and experiencing the outdoors. When I am not climbing, I am either reading, playing music, or spending time playing card games with my wife. We like to walk to nearby coffee shops and play games.</p>
